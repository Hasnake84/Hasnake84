**Cybersecurity practitioner with a passion for proactive defense and continuous learning. I specialize in cloud security, SIEM engineering, and real-world incident response. My work spans threat detection, EDR/XDR investigations, log analysis (including PowerShell, LOLBins, and fileless malware), and vulnerability management. I turn curiosity into action through hands-on labs and detection-driven projects that deliver measurable security value.**
